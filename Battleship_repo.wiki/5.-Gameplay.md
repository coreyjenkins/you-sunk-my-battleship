The concept of this game is guessing the location of the other player’s ships.
Usually, 5 ships will be given to each player.

Each ship has different size, so the size represents life of ship. 
To destroy the size 5 of ship, the ship needs to be shot 5 times.

The ships will be located by user before start the game. There is field to locate the ships and the field is consist of many countable squares.
Once player locates the ships and start game, the player will not be able to change the location of any ship.

A player can only ‘shot’ one point in each turn and the turn is over to the other player regardless of result. 
The game will be continue, until all ships of player are destroyed.
